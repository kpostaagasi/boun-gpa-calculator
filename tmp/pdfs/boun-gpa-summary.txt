BOUN GPA Calculator - One-Page Summary
======================================

WHAT IT IS
A lightweight, client-side GPA calculator web app for Bogazici University
students, built as a static site with offline support.

WHO IT'S FOR
Primary persona: Bogazici University students who want to compute semester
and cumulative GPA quickly on desktop or mobile.

WHAT IT DOES
- Calculates semester GPA (SPA) and overall GPA using BOUN grading rules.
- Lets users add courses, credits, grades, and retake info.
- Supports multiple universities via a selector (BOUN, ITU, ODTU, etc.).
- Shows charts for grade distribution, GPA trends, and credit breakdown.
- Saves data locally and supports import/export plus shareable outputs.
- Offers themes and language switching, plus PWA offline capability.

HOW IT WORKS (REPO EVIDENCE)
- UI: `index.html` + `styles.css` render the single-page interface.
- Logic: `script.js` handles calculations, i18n, state, and UI updates.
- Storage: `localStorage` persists GPA data, theme, language, university.
- Charts/Export: Chart.js and html2canvas loaded via CDN for visuals/exports.
- PWA: `service-worker.js` caches app shell and assets; `site.webmanifest`
  declares installable metadata.
- Data flow: user inputs -> JS state -> GPA calculations -> DOM + charts ->
  localStorage save; service worker caches static assets for offline use.

HOW TO RUN (MINIMAL)
- Clone the repo (README.md).
- Open `index.html` in a browser (static site).
- Not found in repo: a local dev server command or build steps.
